While the funnel cloud was rather wide at times, the actual contact with the ground was quite narrow, as evidenced by the narrow damage track.",0

At this point, according to radar and storm damage indicators, the tornado rapidly intensified. An outbuilding was totally destroyed near Sycamore Road, and the tornado caused extensive tree damage east of 330th Road, south of Minden. The tornado intensified further, and widened to approximately 1200 yards as it impacted the town of Minden. Video and spotter reports indicate that there were multiple vortices within the tornado near Minden and points northeast, and there was evidence of narrow zones of the most intense damage which lines up very well with the multiple vortex tornado concept. In fact, there were damage indicators of EF-1 damage and high-end EF-3 damage within only 100 yards of each other. The most intense damage was on the far east side of Minden. Numerous homes were uninhabitable and several homes were completely destroyed. There were also several sizeable metal buildings southeast of Main Street that were completely destroyed. The construction of these metal structures and the homes that were most impacted, in conjunction with the tree damage and damage to cars with few if any cars being lofted and thrown indicated that this was a very strong EF-3 tornado, near the top of the damage range for an EF-3. The damage to the town of Minden was extensive, with three injuries. A fourth person succumbed to their injuries after the event, resulting in the only direct fatality of this tornado outbreak in the OAX area. The tornado continued northeast of Minden where it produced EF-3 damage at two homes along 345th Street. One of the homes was somewhat intact but was removed from its foundation and slid approximately 10 yards to the northeast. The other home had only small interior rooms remaining. It is worth noting that these two homes were 700 yards apart along the north-south street. EF-2 damage occurred along Whippoorwill Road.

The tornado appears to have been widest near 750th Street and Hackberry Road, at approximately 1900 yards in width based on tree and powerline damage. At Highway 44, a home was destroyed along with substantial tree damage. Most walls of the home were standing, but a large automobile was thrown or rolled nearly a quarter mile. The tree and vehicle damage suggested that this location was a stronger section of the tornado, and was subsequently rated EF-3.

The tornado continued northeast crossing agricultural fields and flipping numerous center pivots, eventually crossing 252nd Street. The tornado caused EF-2 damage as it approached Highway 92, damaging numerous homes and striking an acreage northwest of the Highway 92 (West Center street) and Highway 275 intersection. Several center pivots were overturned as the tornado continued northeast crossing east of Highway 275, causing EF-2 damage to several acreages, homes, and outbuildings along Highway 275/240th Street. Continuing northeast, the tornado crossed 234th Street near Harney Street where it damaged a horse farm and an acreage as well as a home along Dodge Street/Highway 6 before crossing Dodge Street causing roof and outbuilding damage at the Junkstock Farm. The tornado crossed the Elkhorn River, damaging trees and flipping center pivots in an acreage along Blondo Street just south of the railroad tracks. The tornado continued into the western part of Elkhorn approximately one-half mile south-southwest of the intersection of West Maple Road and 216th Street. One home sustained high-end EF-2 damage losing large sections of its roofs. Another home just to the north had total destruction of the structure, resulting in EF-4 damage. The tornado moved across Prospect Hills Cemetery, damaging headstones, and moved across West Maple Avenue severely damaging a landscape business before entering the Ramblewood subdivision. Numerous homes in the subdivision received EF-3 damage with only small interior rooms standing. EF-3 damage persisted as the tornado continued north-northeastward damaging homes between 212th Street and Kestrel Parkway, again leaving only interior rooms standing.  Two homes at the intersection of North 212th Street and Larimor Avenue were completely destroyed, resulting in a second instance of EF-4 damage. The tornado then crossed Fort Street about one-third of a mile east of 216th Street, causing the collapse of new development homes. This damage was also consistent with that of an EF-3 tornado. The tornado then veered to the northeast across mainly rural areas of northwestern Douglas County, between Fort Street and Military Road. By the time the tornado crossed Highway 31, it reached its peak width of 1 mile wide. EF-1 damage was noted in this area with several power poles and trees snapped. The tornado narrowed to about one-half mile wide and moved into residential development just northwest of the intersection of 180th Street and Military Road, where EF-1 damage was observed due to loss of roofs. The tornado then moved into Bennington���s Newport Landing neighborhood, causing high-end EF-2 damage by removing large sections of several home's roofs and collapsing some exterior walls. The tornado then moved across Bennington Lake, crossing just west of the intersection of Highway 36 and 168th Street, snapping the tops off of numerous trees. It then moved across agricultural land, damaging farm outbuildings southeast of the intersection of 168th Street and Dutch Hall Road, before crossing into Washington County.  All walls of this home were collapsed. However, the walls were not attached to the foundation in a way that would discriminate between EF-3 and EF-4 damage. Thus, high-end EF-3 damage was determined. Peak estimated winds for this segment of the tornado's track were at 170 miles per hour. The maximum width of the tornado in this segment was 1450 yards, with an average width of approximately 900 yards.",0

The width of the tornado at this time ranged from one-third to one-half mile wide. The most significant damage was sustained to a home, machine shop and horse barn, one-third of a mile southeast of the intersection of County Road 40 and County Road 29. Trees were snapped and debarked, the house was moved from its foundation, flat-bed and horse-trailers rolled or lofted, and the machine shop and horse barns destroyed. The storm damage survey following this tornado determined high-end EF-3 damage occurred here. At least one horse was killed, and several others were injured. After this, the tornado crossed the intersection of County Road 36 and County Road 31, producing EF-0 to EF-1 damage in the form of partial roof and siding loss to farm buildings and manufactured homes, plus the snapping of large tree limbs. As it approached State Highway 133, several homes and farm outbuildings sustained EF-2 damage due to the loss of roofs or exterior walls. Crossing Highway 133, the tornado was just less than one-half mile wide, and moved into residential areas generally between County Road 32 and US Highway 75. The most significant damage of the whole tornado track occurred near the intersections of County Road P30 and County Road 33 with the destruction of multiple homes. Several houses were rated with high-end EF-3 damage, and one house was rated as receiving EF-4 damage. Peak winds in this area were estimated to be 170 miles per hour. The tornado then crossed US Highway 75 about 2 miles southeast of Blair moving across the very southern portion of the Cargill plant. The tornado weakened and narrowed, but snapped power poles and derailed several empty rail container cars from the tracks, resulting in EF-1 damage.

Two greenhouses had the plastic roofing material thrown several hundred yards. Three well-built barns next to the greenhouses sustained no damage, nor did the farmhouse. NWS drone photography showed distinct tree damage and greenhouse debris.

The  tornado was 85 mph, EF0, with a width of 250 yards.||At this point, the tornado came down the large hill overlooking Milton and widened significantly, moving parallel to the sharpest curve on US 421. Half of the tornado was over the Ohio River and the other half was just north of US 421 mainly along Coopers|Bottom Road. There was a plethora of tree damage all the way to the Milton-Madison Bridge. The tornado was 90 mph, EF1, with a width of around 400 yards. Some of the most dramatic tornado video shows the tornado partially over the Ohio River, sucking up water and throwing it in all directions.||EF-0 and EF-1 damage continued as the southern half of the funnel entered Milton, doing roof and structural damage to numerous homes and businesses. In addition, numerous hardwood trees were either snapped or uprooted. Just east of downtown Milton, a large brick home under renovation had a large section of its back wall blown|out, with estimated winds of 105 mph, which was a bit stronger than points to the west. Noted strengthening occurred over the next mile eastward as more concentrated medium to high end EF-1 damage was noted. Evidence that the center of the tornado was still out over water at this point was strong, given that the downed trees were facing toward the river in almost all instances from Milton eastward until Paradise Point along Highway 36 about 1 mile east of downtown Milton.||The center of the tornado finally came on shore at Paradise Point and was immediately at low-end EF-2 strength as several large campers and a motorhome were demolished. One tri-axle camper weighing well over 10,000 pounds was rolled and thrown over 100 yards to the ESE, with debris scattered much farther downstream. Just across Highway 36, a well-built single family residence sustained major roof damage as half of the structure was removed by the tornado. This was also rated at EF-2 strength with winds of 115 mph. Just east of that house, a semi trailer was rolled, a large barn was  completely collapsed and shifted, and nearly every tree was snapped in a grove. This was a notable uptick in intensity from areas to the west as snapped trees were more sporadic in those areas. This was more justification for the increase to EF-2. It was at this point that a clear northern portion of the tornado track became evident as downed trees along Highway 36 were laying in a SE direction, pointing inward toward the center of the circulation.

The tornado caused roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center near the intersection of Capital Circle Northwest and U.S. 90. The tornado appears to have intensified as it moved southeast after crossing Capital Circle and approaching Blountstown Highway. EF-2 damage was noted to an automotive repair building along Blountstown Highway, along with intense tree damage, with a swath of nearly every pine tree snapped at approximately 75 feet above the ground. This level of damage continues across Pat Thomas Boulevard. Significant tree damage was noted on the campuses of Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College before the tornado crossed Appleyard Drive. Another area of intense tree damage was noted along Cactus Drive, consistent with an EF-2 rating. Numerous homes were damaged by falling trees. The tornado then moved through a densely populated area of single family and multi-family homes, causing widespread EF-1 tree damage. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by falling trees as the tornado crossed Pensacola Street and approached the Florida State University Campus. Numerous trees were downed on the southwestern part of the campus. In addition, the tent housing the Florida State University Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged. The tornado moved along Gaines Street, causing damage to a few businesses, and causing a construction crane to collapse. At Railroad Square, several warehouse buildings were severely damaged, along with the roof of the railroad depot. Snapped and uprooted trees were also noted in the downtown area, just south of the State Capital Building near the state Department of Education Building. At this point, the tornado began to turn more southeastward as it began to interact with the nearby tornado to its south. The tornado caused damage at Cascades Park, and significant tree damage in Myers Park. The tornado then moved through Country Club Estates and onto the Capital City Country Club.

This included roof damage to at least two university buildings. EF-0 damage was observed a handful of times to eve's on homes and businesses as well as occasional shingle damage. The tornado would continue moving east toward Capital City Country Club Golf Course producing EF-1 damage by snapping numerous trees along the way and across the golf course. The tracks of both tornadoes moving through Tallahassee at this time converged at Capital City Country Club, with this tornado seemingly becoming the dominant circulation moving forward. As the tornado exited the golf course, very intense tree damage consistent with an EF-2 rating was observed as numerous trees were snapped at a height of around 75 feet. This most intense tree damage occurred from Country Club Dr. through the Indian Head Acres subdivisions. This is where the maximum estimated winds of 115mph most likely occurred. EF-1 damage would be observed through the remainder of its eastern trajectory as the tornado impacted Old St. Augustine Rd. It would go on producing EF-1 tree damage within the subdivision of Paradise Village East, Old Friends Rd, and areas along Southwood Plantation Rd before moving on to mostly forested areas north of Old St. Augustine Rd. The last concentrated area of EF-1 damage would be observed in neighborhoods along Louvinia Drive and WW Lee Road. The tornado would then continue east before uprooting a few trees along U.S. 27 as it moved to the Leon-Jefferson county line before dissipating. The tornado reached its maximum width of 1400yds as it crossed Monroe St. in downtown Tallahassee and entered into the Capital City Country Club Golf Course.

The highest rated damage actually was at the very start of the tornado where a barn was almost completely destroyed with many trees snapped and uprooted on that property. A well-built residence did receive damage at this location, but this was deemed to be mostly from portions of the barn and other trees flying onto the structure. From there, the tornado crossed Interstate 49, although tree damage there was not considerable. The next road impacted on the north-northeast path of the tornado was Farris Lane where a few mobile homes received minor damage and quite a few trees were downed in random directions. The tornado continued onward and another increase in strength was observed as it passed just on the western side of Frierson. There, on a short road just south of Polk Avenue, the tornado managed to throw a small metal building system (MBS) after the column anchorages failed. This sort of damage has potential to garner a rating greater than EF-1, but in this case much tamer damage immediately surrounding the MBS led the survey team to rate this damage point at just less than 100 mph. Portions of the MBS actually flew into a different property along Stonewall-Frierson Road and produced car and property damage related to the impact. The tornado only continued a little farther from this point and the last signs of damage related to the tornado were at a westward bend to Stonewall-Frierson Road on the north side of Frierson.
