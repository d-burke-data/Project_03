# U.S. Tornado Events Analysis
This interactive web application dashboard is based on nearly 80k tornado event records in the U.S. from 1950-2024. Explore the final product here: https://d-burke-data.github.io/Project_03/

Three main parts:
1) **ETL:** an ETL pipeline to load a relational SQLite database with three tables (*using Python*)
2) **API:** a Flask app API (publicly available here: https://bmitri.pythonanywhere.com/) to interact with the database for the backend of the web app (*using Python*)
3) **Web Application:** interactive dashboard with filter options for time, location, & tornado intensity (*using JavaScript and HTML*)

## Frontend: Web App
Interactive dashboard web app with dropdown options to filter data by time (required), location, & EF-scale. The following visualizations are generated by data from API calls based on user-inputs:

### Leaflet Map
Comes with three overlay options:
- **Counties:** combines API outputed data with GeoJSON to generate colored overlay based on number of events per county
- **Events:** utilizes individual event data to plot begin and end points of each event to showcase their path as well as detailed information in the popup
    - ***Triangle:*** begin point of tornado event 
    - ***Square:*** end point of tornado event (only visible when zooming into map)
    - ***Path:*** arrows pointing in the direction of the tornado's path. The longer the path, the larger the arrows
    - ***Marker color:*** based on EF-scale
- **Heatmap:** based on latitude and longitude begin points from each event

**Ex) Zoomed in map with Events layer over Counties layer:** clearly shows tornado events crossing county borders and even changing EF-scale ranking:

### Plotly Charts
- **Pie chart:** displaying percentages of events categorized by their EF-scale ranking
- **Bar chart:** displays totals by month with options to see total events, deaths, injuries, property damage, or crop damage per month

### Summary Tables
- **Duration:** shows total time of tornado events during period and average time each tornado took
- **Totals:** shows overall totals for events, deaths, injuries and damages costs (property and crop)

## Backend: API & Database
Created an ETL pipeline to load transformed storm events & counties data to SQLite relational database with three tables: events, counties, and scales.

The Flask app API utilizes an ORM, SQLAlchemy, to interact with the relational database to produce jsonified queried data. Access the API here: https://bmitri.pythonanywhere.com/

**Main routes (with endpoints):**
- `/api/v1.0/dashboard`: produces filtered aggregated data for the entire dashboard and Counties map overlay
- `/api/v1.0/events`: produces filtered individual events data with counties data for the Events and Heatmap overlay (ex: lat/lon for each event)

**Endpoints:**
- ***Required:*** `?start_year` and `?duration` (number of years)
- ***Optional:*** `?state` (state abbreviation), `?fip` (county FIP code), and `?scale` (EF/F scale level)
- Example API URL: https://bmitri.pythonanywhere.com/api/v1.0/dashboard?start_year=2010&duration=10&state=IL&fip=17099&scale=1

**Extra routes (without endpoints):**
- `/api/v1.0/options`: lists years and states available in the database (*populates Years & States dropdown in web app*)
- `/api/v1.0/counties`: counties table data (*populates Counties dropdown in web app*)
- `/api/v1.0/scales`: scales table data (*populates EF-Scale dropdown in web app*)

**Ex) Dashboard route vs Events route:** both are using the same endpoints but we can see here (in the console of the web app) that the dashboard route produces the *aggregated data* needed for the tables/charts and county heatmap. Meanwhile, the events route produces the *individual records* to be able to capture data for each event such as lat/lon for the events and heatmap overlays.
